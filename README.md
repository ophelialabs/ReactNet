    Create a mesh network with two agents: const agent1 = new MeshAgent('agent1', 35.0456, -85.3097); const agent2 = new MeshAgent('agent2', 35.9606, -83.9207);

await agent1.joinMesh(); await agent2.joinMesh();

    Example quantum state transfer await agent1.sendQuantumState('agent2', { fidelity: 0.98, qubitCount: 10 });

This implementation provides:

Bi-directional gRPC communication Mesh network topology Quantum state transfer between agents Supervisor coordination of the mesh network Real-time status updates through the mesh The supervisor acts as the gRPC server while agents are clients, allowing for efficient communication and state management across the quantum network

HDF5 is the current or planned data format for missions including Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) and Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS ), totaling many 10s of terabytes of data. Users cite many strengths, including: Widespread planned use for NASA Earth science data.
